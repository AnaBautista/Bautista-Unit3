<p> "I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done.
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you" -Avenged Sevenfold </p>
<p> "Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you,
always. Kiss you, taste you all night, 
Always." -Blink 182</p>
<p> "I used to pray like God was listening.
I used to make my parents proud.
I was the glue that kept my friends together,
Now they don't talk and we don't go out." -Brand New</p>
<p>"I rely on myself just making sure that was clear. I'm not in need of your crutches,
I've faced all my fears and I won what I knew I could have.
Life is not a punch card make the best of what you have" -A Day To Remember</p>
<p> "I think the thing is that I shut off from everything.
From friends and family and my own ambitions.
From having fun.
I just shut off from everything.
Self-defeating? Yeah, probably."
-La Dispute</p>
